title: Budget-Constrained Bandits over General Cost and Reward Distributions
abstract: We consider a budget-constrained bandit problem where each arm pull incurs
  a random cost, and yields a random reward in return. The objective is to maximize
  the total expected reward under a budget constraint on the total cost. The model
  is general in the sense that it allows correlated and potentially heavy-tailed cost-reward
  pairs as required by many applications. We show
  that if moments of order $(2+\gamma)$ for some $\gamma > 0$ exist for all cost-reward
  pairs, $O(\log B)$ regret is achievable for a budget $B>0$. In order to achieve
  tight regret bounds, we propose algorithms that exploit the correlation between
  the cost and reward of each arm by extracting the common information via linear
  minimum mean-square error estimation. We prove a regret lower bound for this problem,
  and show that the proposed algorithms achieve tight problem-dependent regret bounds,
  which are optimal up to a universal constant factor in the case of jointly Gaussian
  cost and reward pairs.
